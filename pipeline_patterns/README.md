# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

# Pipeline in Pandas

# Function composition

# Overall

You will probably never implement the core of this pattern yourself since the functionality will probably be built into libraries that you're already using, like Pandas.

There are a number of packages out there that help you build all kinds of complex pipelines and workflows. Two of them are:

Luigi: https://github.com/spotify/luigi

Airflow: https://airflow.apache.org

Unless you need something very basic, use one of these existing packages. Or if your workflow is based around for example Pandas, there is pipeline functionality built in.
